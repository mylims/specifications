# Contributing to MyLims

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to MyLims and its packages, which are hosted in the [MyLims Organization](https://github.com/mylims) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How to contribute?

#### **Did you find a bug?**
* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mylims/mylims/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mylims/mylims/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**
* Fork the repossitory and create a brach with the proposed changes.
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
