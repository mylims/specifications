General comment: Deep etching of GaN

Description:

This recipe can be followed for deep etching of GaN with an etch rate of 150 nm/min. Process done at CMi.

Steps

Sample preparation: Warm a wafer up to 135 C, use quick stick gel and put the sample on top. Later let the wafer cool down.
Process run: Time: 3' Estimated etch depth: 450 nm
Sample unload: Warm the wafer up to 135 C and remove the sample on top. Later let the wafer and the sample cool down.
